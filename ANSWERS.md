- [ ] Why would you use class component over function components (removing hooks from the question)?

<!--  Class components enable access to setState to help track the state of components and allows changes to be made to the application based on its state. Class components also contain built-in Lifecycle Methods that can run at specific times within the life of the application through the use of componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount methods.  -->

- [ ] Name three lifecycle methods and their purposes.

<!--  The componentDidMount method can run and fetch data from a database when the component first mounts and renders on the DOM.  -->

<!--  The componentDidUpdate method is called when a component's state changes based on input and interaction with the application. It can take prevState and prevProps as arguments to run changes on the DOM.  -->

<!--  The componentWillUnmount method is called before a component is removed from the DOM and can cleanup the application by canceling network requests or service subscriptions.  -->

- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?

<!--   Custom hooks can hook into the React state to reuse logic or manipulate the state of components while keeping the effects isolated inside the component.  -->

- [ ] Why is it important to test our apps?

<!--  Testing minimizes the risk of bugs, acts as a safety net when making changes to the application, and increases the reliability of the code.  -->
